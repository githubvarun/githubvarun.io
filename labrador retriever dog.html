<h2>Important and nice points about this dog</h2>

	<ul>
		<p>1.The most distinguishing characteristics of the Labrador Retriever are its short, dense, weather resistant coat; an otter tail; a clean-cut head with broad back skull and moderate stop; powerful jaws; and its kind friendly eyes, expressing character, intelligence and good temperament.</p>
	    <p>2.One of the best dogs for children of all ages, Labrador Retrievers are kindly, good-natured, and take most things in stride. Most Labs are friendly with everyone, though compared to Golden Retrievers, many Labs are just a bit more conservative with their affections.</p>
	    <p>3.The Labrador is by its nature, an energetic, outgoing dog that likes to play and run around. However, it would be a mistake to think that the Labrador cannot be prone to laziness, particularly as they get older, and the Labrador is definitely one dog that is prone to piling on the pounds with relative ease.</p>
