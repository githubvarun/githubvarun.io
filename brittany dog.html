<h2>Important and nice points about this dog</h2>    

	<ul>
		<p>1.Brittanys are smaller than setters but leggier than spaniels, standing about 20 inches at the shoulder. Their beautiful, boldly patterned coat comes in combinations of white and vivid orange and liver (reddish-brown). They are rugged and strong but smooth, clean, and quick afoot. The face has the softness prized by bird-dog lovers; high-set ears convey the breeds essential eagerness.</p>
	    <p>2.The Brittany is a breed of gun dog bred primarily for bird hunting. Although it is often referred to as a spaniel, the breed's working characteristics are more akin to those of a pointer or setter.</p>
