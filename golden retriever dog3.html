<h2>Important and nice points about this dog</h2>
<ul>
	<p>1.The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name.The broad head, with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight muzzle, is a breed hallmark.</p>
    <p>2.The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate. Golden retrievers are playful, yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other pets and strangers. ... Golden retrievers are not often barkers, and they lack guard instincts, so do not count on them to make good watchdogs.</p>
    <p>3.They're calm, loving, docile, and overly welcoming (making them awful guard dogs). ... Often a dog will be overly playful in their puppy years (having not developed their maturity), a bit goofy, and as they grow, they'll become a bit more reserved, calm, and lazy</p>
